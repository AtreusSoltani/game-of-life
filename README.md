# Conway's Game Of Life


Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid evolve based on simple rules. Each cell can be alive or dead, and their states change with each generation. Live cells with too few or too many neighbors die, while dead cells with exactly three neighbors become alive. The game showcases the emergence of complex patterns from simple rules, captivating mathematicians and computer scientists. It has applications in diverse fields and demonstrates how simplicity can give rise to intricate and evolving behaviors in a virtual world.
